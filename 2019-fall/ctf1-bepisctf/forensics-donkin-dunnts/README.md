* **(Optional) Tools Required / Used:** [Steganographic Decoder](https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html)
​

## Steps​
#### Step 1
The prompt mentions something about encoding information into an image, as well as 'steganosaurus'. If you search up something along the lines of 'stegosaurus encoding' or 'stegosaurus forensics', you should stumble upon the actual word I was trying to remember, [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography).

#### Step 2
While there is software you can download to decode information from steganographic images, the quickest way to extract the data is, as usual, by using an online tool! If you plug in the image to a website like [this](https://futureboy.us/stegano/decinput.html) and click decode, you will be presented with the flag: `utflag{t1m_h0rt0ns_1s_b3tt3r}`.
