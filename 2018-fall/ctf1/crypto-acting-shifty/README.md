When you open the image file, you will see `uiuweg{0jx_0fm_b@vj3ex3}`, which looks like a flag, but it seems to be gibberish.

#### Step 2
Based on the name of the file and the challenge title, you should be able to find out that this is a [Vigenere Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher).
