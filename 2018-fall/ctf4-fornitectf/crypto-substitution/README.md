## Stepsâ€‹
#### Step 1
If you open `transmission.txt`, you will see that it's full of a bunch of emojis. There's also a table which associates emojis to numbers. This should hint to you that this is a [substitution cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher). 

#### Step 2
You can use an online tool to figure out the original plaintext, and then add in the substitutions for numbers. Then you should be able to see the flag: `att3nt10n a11 gam3rs`.
