You have a deck of cards, right? Well, you probably won't need *all* of them.

```
Starting shuffle: [8, 24, 9, 7, 17, 25, 26, 23, 13, 19, 34, B, 3, 27, 11, A, 6, 18, 4, 15, 14, 1, 31, 29, 35, 20, 2, 30, 10, 5, 36, 32, 22, 21, 33, 16, 12, 28]
Flag: utflag{dkzcewlbphoym}
```

(You only need to decode the part inside the curly brackets)
