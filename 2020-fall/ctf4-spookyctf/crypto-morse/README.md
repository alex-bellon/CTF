## Steps
#### Step 1
The title of the challenge refers to the 'dah's and 'dit's of [Morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). You could also figure out that this is morse code based on the fact that there are two types of characters that are used in chunks of 1-4 characters.

#### Step 2
Once you find and replace all of the 0s with dots and the 1s with dashes, you can put the morse code into [an online tool like this](https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html) to get the plaintext flag: `utflag dots and dashes`.
