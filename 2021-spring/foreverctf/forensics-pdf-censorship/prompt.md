# Redacted

I recieved this document from ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛ at ⬛⬛⬛⬛, but it looks like the flag was redacted by ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛. There's probably no way to get it back, right?

## Hint

See if you highlight any text on the page. Or, you may want to look into tools that extract the text out of PDFs, like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdftotext) (note that this is different from using OCR to recognize the text on the page).
