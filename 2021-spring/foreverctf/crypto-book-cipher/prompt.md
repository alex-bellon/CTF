# Bookworm

One of my friends is a real bookworm, lately they've been reading [Pride and Prejudice](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt). They sent me this secret message, can you decrypt it?

```
utflag{30:01:11:04_39:08:02:08_51:07:05:11}
This should help: CHA:PAR:LIN:WOR
```

(You only need to decode the part inside the curly braces)
