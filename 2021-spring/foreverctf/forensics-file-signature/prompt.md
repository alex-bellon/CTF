# Magic

I think there's something wrong with this file-- it won't open! Maybe you could look at the [hexdump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump) of the file and see if there's something wrong there?

## Hint

Computers know what format a file is based off of the [file signature or "magic header"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number). Is there anything weird with this one? ([This might be a useful resource to look at](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures))

## Hint 2

You can use a tool like [Bless](https://github.com/afrantzis/bless) to edit the hex of the file. Maybe you can use that to fix the file?
