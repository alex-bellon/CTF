# Nothing In Between

This is not the flag: `utflag{i_promise_you_this_isnt_the_flag}`

## Hint

[Did you know that there are ASCII characters that take up no space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space)? There may be some in the flag...

## Hint 2

There only seem to be two zero width characters, and they're alternating-- almost like 1s and 0s in binary!

## Hint 3

Try converting the zero width characters to binary with '\\u200B' as 0 and '\\u200C' as 1, and see if you can decode that to ASCII.
