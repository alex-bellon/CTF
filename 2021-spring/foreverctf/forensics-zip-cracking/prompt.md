# Zipped

I found this old ZIP archive on my computer, I think it has a really useful flag inside. Can you figure out how to open it? I remember that I used a pretty common password.

## Hint

See if you can find any tools you can use to try a bunch of passwords (maybe a [dictionary attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack)?) on an encrypted ZIP archive.

## Hint 2

Maybe you can try cracking the archive open with a tool like [fcrackzip](https://github.com/hyc/fcrackzip), [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/), or [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) and a nice [password list](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials).
