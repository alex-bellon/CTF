# Met A Data

See if you can find the flag hidden in this picture. Well, I guess it isn't really *in* the picture, just part of the file.

## Hint

Are there any commands or programs you can use to see the [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) of a file/image?

## Hint 2

Try running the command line program `strings` on the image and looking for the file. You can also use an online tool like [this one](https://www.exifdata.com/index.php).
