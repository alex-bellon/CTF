# Uncharted

Just found all these numbers, apparently they correspond to a flag?

**Note: make sure to wrap the flag in `utflag{}` before submitting**

## Hint

Hey, these numbers kind of look like latitude and longitude coordinates! Maybe you can map them?

## Hint 2

Try plugging the coordinates into [mapping software](https://www.mapcustomizer.com/#) and see if you can connect the dots (the gaps denote seprate letters)
