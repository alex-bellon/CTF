## Steps
#### Step 1
You are given two images, so your best bet is to compare them to each other. Since they're both static that's pretty difficult, so your best bet is to [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff) them somehow.

#### Step 2
Using an online tool like [this](https://www.diffchecker.com/image-diff/), or another method of your choosing, you will see that the pixels that differ spell out the flag: `utflag{too_noisy}`.
