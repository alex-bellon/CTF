# DH-9000

The robots just introduced this supposedly unbreakable crypto scheme that allows them to share secrets over insecure channels, DH-9000. I'm pretty sure this isn't anything new though, so we should still be able to find their shared secret.

```
p = 8089
g = 823

A = 1228
B = 6820
```

**Note: submit either the shared secret or the shared secret wrapped in `utflag{}`**

## Hint

Hey, that p looks pretty small O.o
