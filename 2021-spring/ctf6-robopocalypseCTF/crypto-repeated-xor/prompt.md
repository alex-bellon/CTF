# Mightier Than The XORd

I encryped this flag with a super secure function I learned about called XOR! There's no way to recover the flag!!!! I think.

```
\x12\x1b\x07\x18\x06\x08\x1a\x1f\x02\x0a\x11\x2b\x0e\x1b\x3e\x1b\x09\x30\x13\x11\x17\x0a\x00\x00\x1a
```

## Hint

See if you can recover the key using the fact that you know the flag starts with `utflag{` and that XOR is a self-inverse (i.e. if you XOR something with itself, it becomes 0).
