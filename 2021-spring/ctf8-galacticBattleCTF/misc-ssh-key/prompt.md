# Key Finding

I intercepted this SSH identicon from Imperial forces, can you figure out what the original hex fingerprint was?

```
+-----------------+
|    E.           |
|      .          |
|     .           |
|      .          |
|       .S        |
|       ..        |
|      .  .       |
|     .    .      |
|      ....       |
+-----------------+
```

**NOTE**: This flag is not in `utflag{}` flag format. The flag is just the plain hex characters (no colons).
