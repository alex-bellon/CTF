## Stepsâ€‹
#### Step 1
If you open up `space.txt`, you'll just see a bunch of dots. Based on the weird spacing in the file and the title of the challenge, you should be able to figure out that this is actually [Whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_%28programming_language%29).

#### Step 2
You can use an online compiler like [this](https://vii5ard.github.io/whitespace/) to run the code. It will then spit out the flag: `utflag{hidden_in_plain_sight}`.
