## Stepsâ€‹
#### Step 1
If you open `output.txt`, you will see that it's full of a bunch of gibberish, but the letters seem to have patterns similar to English. This should hint to you that this is a [substitution cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher). 

#### Step 2
You can use an online tool to figure out the original plaintext, and at the end is the flag: `utflag{hopeyoudidntdothisbyhand}`.
