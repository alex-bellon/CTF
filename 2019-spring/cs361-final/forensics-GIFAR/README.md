## Stepsâ€‹
#### Step 1
If you open `gifar.jpg`, you'll see that the flag isn't there. If you use a tool like `binwalk` on the file though, you'll see that there is a ZIP file embedded in the image. 

#### Step 2
You could try to file carve the ZIP out, but because of the way ZIP has its file headers/trailers set up, you can also just run `unzip gifar.jpg`. This will give you a file with the flag: `utflag{stop_making_live_remakes}`.
