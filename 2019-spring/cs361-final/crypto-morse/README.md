## Stepsâ€‹
#### Step 1
If you play the audio, at the end of the song you will here some beeping that seems to have a pattern. You can also open the audio in something like Audacity and see that there are long and short beeps at the end. 

#### Step 2 
The pattern should hint to you that this is Morse code, and you can even plug the audio straight into an online tool [like this](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) to get the flag: `UTFLAGB33PB00PB33PB33P`
