* **(Optional) Tools Required / Used:**

## Stepsâ€‹
#### Step 1
You are given a bunch of bytes, and based on the prompt you should be able to determine that the flag was "encrypted" by XORing it with something else. 

#### Step 2
Since you know that XOR inverts itself, and you know what the flag format is, you can try XORing the beginning of the flag (`utflag{`) with the ciphertext.

#### Step 3
When you do that, you will see that the other value we XORed with was `s3cr3t`, so you can just repeat that out until it is the length of the ciphertext and then XOR them together to get the flag: `utflag{th3_p3n_is_mighti3r_th@n_th3_xor}`.
